        <h1>Pricing and Info</h1>
        <p>My prices vary by cup size and design. So please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> to discuss details.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul id="minfo">
            <li> I also do cups without glitter (spray paint)</li>
            <li> All cups are sealed with a FDA compliant epoxy. It makes it safe for food and drinks and can withheld
                normal
                every day to day exposure.
            </li>
            <li> When putting in your order be as detailed as possible so I know exactly what you’re wanting. (color,
                name
                and/or image, vinyl color, etc) Pictures for inspiration is ALWAYS appreciated. I will then send you an
                invoice with the agreed upon price.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p id="invoice"><b>**I do NOT start on an order until the invoice is paid for!**</b></p>
        <br>
        <p> So please make sure to get it paid if you want me to get started on it. I accept PayPal, cash, or debit
            card,I
            have a PayPal card reader. If you want to pay by cash or debit card please <a href="contact.html">let me
            know</a> and I will send an invoice to your email for the debit card payment or give you my address to
            drop
            the cash off at.
        </p>
        <p> Please allow at LEAST 3-5wks to finish. These cups are not something that can be rushed. Most of the time I
            get
            them finished much sooner than that but I also work during the day and have a family that is very active in
            sports. That is priority. So please don’t message me saying “I need this in 3 days.” It won’t happen!
        </p>
        <p> Once the order is complete I will message you to arrange pick up. I prefer pick up at my house but I will
            arrange
            to meet with you, if needed. If you aren’t local then I will send you the shipping confirmation with
            tracking #.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for your patience and your business.
        </p>

        <h1>How to care for:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Hand wash ONLY! These cups are vacuum sealed stainless cups. The dishwasher will mess up the vacuum
                seal. Some dishwashers also exceed the 130* temp that the epoxy can withstand.
            </li>
            <li>Do not soak!</li>
            <li>Do not microwave!</li>
            <li>Do not leave in a HOT car. The epoxy is not recommended for temperatures exceeding 130&#8457; (54.4444&#8451;) </li>
        </ul>
