    "I love my nightmare before Christmas cup! I get so many compliments, and them asking where I got it 
    from!! Best cup I’ve ever gotten!"

    Andi made a custom order cup for me. It was made to the T without so much as one piece of glitter 
    out of place. The work was very detail oriented, and professional. The cup is tougher than I expected 
    from a custom cup. No cheap materials here, and Andi herself is very professional treating every 
    piece as if it's a true piece of art; putting care into it, and making it as personal as possible. 
    Super happy and will be ordering again! Thanks Andi!"

Pricing and Info

My prices vary by cup size and design. So please PM me to discuss details.

• I also do cups without glitter (spray paint)
• All cups are sealed with a FDA compliant epoxy. It makes it safe for food and drinks and can withheld normal every day to day exposure.
• When putting in your order be as detailed as possible so I know exactly what you’re wanting. (color, name and/or image, vinyl color, etc) Pictures for inspiration is ALWAYS appreciated. I will then send you an invoice with the agreed upon price.

**I do NOT start on an order until the invoice is paid for!**

So please make sure to get it paid if you want me to get started on it. I accept PayPal, cash, or debit card, I have a PayPal card reader. If you want to pay by cash or debit card please let me know and I will send an invoice to your email for the debit card payment or give you my address to drop the cash off at.

Please allow at LEAST 3-5wks to finish. These cups are not something that can be rushed. Most of the time I get them finished much sooner than that but I also work during the day and have a family that is very active in sports. That is priority. So please don’t message me saying “I need this in 3 days.” It won’t happen!

Once the order is complete I will message you to arrange pick up. I prefer pick up at my house but I will arrange to meet with you, if needed. If you aren’t local then I will send you the shipping confirmation with tracking #.

Thank you for your patience and your business.

HOW TO CARE FOR:
• Hand wash ONLY! These cups are vacuum sealed stainless cups. The dishwasher will mess up the vacuum seal. Some dishwashers also exceed the 130* temp that the epoxy can withstand.
• Do not soak!
• Do not microwave!
• Do not leave in a HOT car. The epoxy is not
recommended for temperatures exceeding 130*
