    from!! Best cup Iâ€™ve ever gotten!"

    Andi made a custom order cup for me. It was made to the T without so much as one piece of glitter 
    out of place. The work was very detail oriented, and professional. The cup is tougher than I expected 
    from a custom cup. No cheap materials here, and Andi herself is very professional treating every 
    piece as if it's a true piece of art; putting care into it, and making it as personal as possible. 
    Super happy and will be ordering again! Thanks Andi!"
